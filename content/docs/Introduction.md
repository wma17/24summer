# 2024 Summer Seminar

## Introduction
Welcome to the 2024 Summer Seminar on **AI: Optimization, Theory & Responsibility**. This session will delve into various aspects of artificial intelligence, focusing on optimization techniques, theoretical foundations, and responsible AI practices. Our goal is to foster a collaborative and enriching learning environment where participants can explore state-of-the-art research and practical applications in these domains.

### Reference Material
Participants are encouraged to refer to the following resource for foundational knowledge and deeper insights: [Understanding Deep Learning](https://udlbook.github.io/udlbook/).

### Schedule
- **Dates:** Every Monday, from July 22th on
- **Location:** Room 341, School of Business
- **Online Tencent Meeting:** 907-2153-6929


### Format
The Seminar will primarily be conducted offline, with potential online channels via Tencent Meeting or Bilibili. Each session will feature presentations by selected participants, with each sub-topic assigned to 1-3 individuals (to be confirmed two weeks in advance).
